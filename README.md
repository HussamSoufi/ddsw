# README

## This is the README for the extension pack "ddsw"

If you are using java jdk 11 then you dont need to do any changes to the extentions.

OTHERWISE

Some changes on the versions need to be done if you're using JAVA 8

* Change redhat.java to Version: 0.64.1
* Change vscjava.vscode-java-test to Version: 0.24.0


**Enjoy!**
